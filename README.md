(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
Actually I study java and python online right now, like for bilibili.com or youtube. My Engilsh is not good enough to understand what you said on class immediately, so I need to restudy it by myself after class. Hence, I think I will keep studying and trying to find some help online or from TA to improve the assignment.
